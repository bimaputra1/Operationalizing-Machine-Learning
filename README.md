# Operationalizing Machine Learning in Azure

## Overview
In this project we aim to predict if a client will subscribe into bank services based on various independent variables from the customers which can be found in this [Bankmarketing Datset](https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv). We build an end to end solution from dataset preparation, model training, deployment, and model monitoring. In addition, we also create a pipeline to automate the process.

This project is part of Udacity Nanodegree

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. In this project, we first learn to deploy the best model of an AutoML run, enable insights on, create documentation for and consume the resultant endpoint. Additionally, we also create, publish and consume a machine learning pipeline with an AutoML step using the Python SDK for Azure.

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Engineer Nanodegree.Here, we have a plan to use Azure ML to to predict if a client will subscribe in the banking based on several independent variables that we have. [Bankmarketing Datset](https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv).We trained our model using AutoML approach and best algorithm selected and deployed as an webservice to Azure Container Instance. At the end, we automated the procedures by creating and deploying a pipeline.
