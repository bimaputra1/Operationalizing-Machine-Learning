# Operationalizing Machine Learning in Azure

## Overview
In this project we aim to predict if a client will subscribe into bank services based on various independent variables from the customers which can be found in this [Bankmarketing Datset](https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv). We build an end to end solution from dataset preparation, model training, deployment, and model monitoring. In addition, we also create a pipeline to automate the process.

## Key Steps

### Step 1 Authentication
In this step, I used lab provided by Udacity. So that I dont need to setup the authentication.

### Step 2 Automated ML Experiment

This step start with uploading [Bankmarketing Datset](https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv) into the Azure ML Studio.

After that, I used the data to performed Automated Machine Learning Experiment using Classification with **y** as a target variable. This variable show that the customer will subscribe or not into the bank services.

As a result, the best model for this experiment is xxx with xx % model accuracy.

### Step 3 Deploy the best model


### Step 4 Enable logging
### Step 5 Swagger Documentation
### Step 6 Consume model endpoints
### Step 7 Create and publish a pipeline
